<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The goal of this project was to develop a program that used AI to recognize human hands through feedback of a webcamera and use that to control audio volume of the computer. This worked by identifying points in the hand for discerning between different fingers, and using that information to change the volume of the computer as we judged best.</p>

  <li><b>Python</b></li>
  <li><b>Mediapipe</b></li>
  <li><b>OpenCV</b></li>

</p>

<p>By typing the title of a movie in the input field, a drop-down list of movies will be shown. The user can select of the the shown titles, type a rating, and add the movie to the list. If a movie is not selected from the drop-down, the user cannot add it to the list.</p>

</p>

<p>In case you decide to have two different accounts, you will notice that they do not share the same list. Each user has their own list and all the rules of the list such as no two entries can have the same name are applicable for each user account.</p>
