<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The goal of this project was to develop a program that used AI to recognize human hands through feedback of a webcamera and use that to control audio volume of the computer. This worked by identifying points in the hand for discerning between different fingers, and using that information to change the volume of the computer as we judged best.</p>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

  <li><b>Python</b></li>
  <li><b>Mediapipe</b></li>
  <li><b>OpenCV</b></li>

<h2>Project Walk-through</h2>

<p>Download files, install OpenCV and mediapipe into Python Interpreter. Run VolumeHandControlAdvanced.py file.</p>

<h3>Hand Tracking</h3>

</p>

<p>The first step is to detect hands in the image and draw landmarks of that hands so that data can be compared and manipulated. This is possible with the help of a technology developed by Google called MediaPipe Hand Landmarker. Not only does this technology perfectly detects hands, it also adds unique points to each joint and enumerates them.  </p>

<h3>Manipulating Landmarks</h3>

</p>

<p>By finding the position of each point of the hand, the program knows how to differentiate between thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Using this information we can create a consistent functionality for the program. Since there are multiple points in each finger, x and y axis of a finger can also be determined, thus enabling us to know if a finger is "up" or "down".</p>

<h3>Volume Setting</h3>

</p>

<p>In our case, here is the logic I have implemented: the distance of the thumb and index finger of a hand will be calculated. The farther they are from each other, the higher the volume will be set. In order for the computer volume to be changed to said volume, the hand's pinky must be "down".</p>
